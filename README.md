# Introduction

This project provides an implementation anomaly detection of OpenPose + RNN. For simplicity, we refer to this model as OpenPoseRNN throughout the rest of this readme. And we also thank to Dr. Minh Chuan-Pham and Dr. Quoc Viet-Hoang supported for this project. This deep learning-based system is being applied in developed countries worldwide such as the UK, France, the USA, and various Asian countries like Japan, South Korea, China, among others. Some universities such as Tsinghua University, Peking University, Stanford University,... used technology to anti-cheating at examination. It is being implemented in collaboration with examination invigilators to achieve the highest effectiveness and ensure the utmost fairness in examinations.

### For Human Detection
For this part, we use [YOLOv3](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3) to detection human in rooms. To evaluation this model we use trainval35k set, which is split from the original [MS-COCO 2017](https://cocodataset.org/#home) dataset. Result shown in Table 1. 

**Table 1. Comparison result of human detection in images with 3 other models**
|    Models   | Avg. | Precision |  IoU |
|:-----------:|:----:|:---------:|:----:|
| [Faster-RCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497) | 21.9 |    42.7   |   -  |
|    SSD300   | 25.2 |    43.1   | 26.1 |
|    YOLOv2   | 21.6 |     44    | 19.2 |
|   **Ours**    |**25.3**| **44.5**   | **25.9** |

### For skeleton position localization

For skeleton position localization, we use [OpenPose]("https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) to detection skeleton human. To evaluate this model we used [MS-COCO2015](https://cocodataset.org/#home) datasets. Result shown in Table 2.

**Table 2. Evaluation results of skeleton position localization compared with 2 other models.**
|     Models    |  AP@0.5  |  AP@0.75 | AP medium | Ap large |
|:-------------:|:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|----------|
| [AlphaPose]() |   89.2   |   79.1   |     69    | 78.6     |
|     Detectron Mask-RCNN    |   25.2   |   43.1   |    26.1   | 68.2     |
|    **Ours**   | **88.0** | **73.1** |  **62.2** | **78.6** |

Beside, we also use FPS and GPU Memory to evluate this. Result shown in Table 3 for Multi people and table 4 for single people.

**Table 3. Results in Multi-people**
|     Models    |  GPU Memory Usage  |  FPS(Frame Per second  |
|:-------------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| AlphaPose |   73.4%   |   1.15   |
|    **Ours**   | **21.3%** | **18.39** |

**Table 4. Results in Single-people**
|     Models    |  GPU Memory Usage  |  FPS(Frame Per second  |
|:-------------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| AlphaPose |   60.3%   |   23.71   |
|    **Ours**   | **21.3%** | **18.77** |

### For recognition 
We used [Recurrrent Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) (RNN) to classify action of attendance in room. To evaluate this part we use 2 metrics are Confusion Matrix and Receiver operating characteristic (ROC). Result shown in [Figure 1](github/image/confMatrix.jpg) and [Figure 2](github/image/RocCurves)

# Installation

### With Python Base
Requirements python >= 3.7 
1. Install dependences library
 ```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Install dependences files
- Change directory to ``` OpenPose/graph_models/VGG_origin```, you can change directory with this command ```cd OpenPose/graph_models/VGG_origin ```
- After you must run ``` file_requirements.py ``` or
 ``` bash
python file_requirements.py
```
3. Install dependences files with other steps ( Optional )
- If you step 2 not successfully you can download weights from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y4coXLsVzCXYuCKpyDfQBqpHH8Aj-Yg5?usp=sharing)
- Move folder ```graph_models``` downloaded to ```OpenPose\graph_models``` 

### With Anaconda 
1. Install dependences library
   - You can load dependences library with ``` openpose.yaml``` file.
   - You can find ```openpose.yaml``` file in folder ```Environment```
2. Install dependences files
- Change directory to ``` OpenPose/graph_models/VGG_origin```, you can change directory with this command ```cd OpenPose/graph_models/VGG_origin ```
- After you must run ``` file_requirements.py ``` or
 ``` bash
python file_requirements.py
```
3. Install dependences files with other steps ( Optional )
- If you step 2 not successfully you can download weights from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y4coXLsVzCXYuCKpyDfQBqpHH8Aj-Yg5?usp=sharing)
- Move folder ```graph_models``` downloaded to ```OpenPose\graph_models``


# Quick Start Overview
### With Python Base Environments and Anaconda Environment
1. Quick Run
 - You can run this file ```main.py``` to start this project. 
2. [Optinal]To trainning model you using ```create_data.py``` to export data points and move to folder ```Action\trainning``` and using .ipnb file ```train.ipnb``` to train.
3. [Optinal] Using VGG_origin can be slow, if you don't have GPU you can change model to ```mobilenet``` to predict faster.
   - To change model to ```mobilenet```, navigation to file ```main.py``` in main folder.
   - In line 14, change ``` estimator = load_pretrain_model('VGG_origin')``` to ```estimator = 
 load_pretrain_model('mobilenet_thin')```
   
4.[Optinal] To use your weight, you can change it in ```main.py```, in line 15 change ```action_classifier = load_action_premodel('open_pose2\Action\framewise_recognition_under_scene.h5')``` to ```action_classifier = load_action_premodel('path_to_your_weights')```
